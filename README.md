- I developed this tool to solve the problem that the path of Windows operating system uses **"\\"** as the separator, and **"\\"** is the escape identifier of many programming languages. By using this program, you can replace all **"\\"** in the copied path with **"/"**. </br>
- Another simple use of this program is to automatically delete the redundant line breaks **"\\n"** in each line when copying the paragraph statements in the PDF file by checking **Delete Enter**. </br>
- You can also use it for any suitable use you can think of.
